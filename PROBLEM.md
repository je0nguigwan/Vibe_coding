## 2. Why Now
Explain why this problem matters *now*, not later.

### Problem 2

## 4. Existing Alternatives
How users solve this problem today.

- Tools, workflows, or hacks currently used: One person scrolling food apps
- Manual processes or human workarounds: Discussion in the group chat, rotating who chooses or one person recommends a restraint.
- Doing nothing / tolerating the pain: Going to the same places again and again. Some people get a bigger opinion and the group has to follow even if they don't like it. In Singapore especially people usually just take takeaway from all the diff restraunts.
