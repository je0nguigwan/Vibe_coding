## Overview

We propose a **group-first food decision platform** for collective dining.

Instead of optimizing for individuals, the system treats the **group as the decision unit**, enabling **fast, fair consensus**.

Awkward discussions are replaced by a **structured decision flow** that surfaces shared preferences without verbal negotiation.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Group as a First-Class Entity

- The group is explicitly modeled as the decision owner
- No indirect aggregation of individual searches
- Temporary shared decision space

Key properties:
- Independent preference input per member
- No single controller of search or filters
- Structural removal of power imbalance

---

### 2. Silent Preference Expression

To reduce social friction and politeness bias:

- Private, asynchronous input
- Swipe-based or quick interactions
- No verbal justification required
- Honest signals without social pressure

Addresses opinion suppression in group settings.

---

### 3. Real-Time Preference Aggregation

The system continuously aggregates inputs to surface **overlap zones**:

- Price range
- Distance / walkability
- Cuisine
- Atmosphere / context fit

AI-driven aggregation updates in real time as inputs arrive, making consensus explicit.

---

### 4. Consensus Detection (Not Ranking)

The goal is not ranking options, but detecting agreement.

- Visual convergence indicators
- Clear "ready-to-decide" signals
- Prevents infinite scrolling and second-guessing

Shifts focus from *best option* → *good-enough-for-everyone*.

---

### 5. Fast, Low-Effort Decisions

Optimized for real-world usage:
- After class
- After work
- Spontaneous meetups

Typical decision time: **< 1 minute**

No dominant decision-maker required.

## Why Existing Solutions Fail

| Approach | Limitation | Our Model |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Google Maps / Yelp | Individual-centric ranking | Group-level aggregation |
| Delivery apps | Delivery-optimized | In-person context-aware |
| Single decider | Fast but unfair | Fast and fair |
| Verbal discussion | Social pressure | Silent honest input |

---

## Key Differentiator

This is **not a recommendation system**.

It is a **decision coordination tool**.

Food choice is treated as a **collective coordination problem**, not individual discovery.

---

## Outcomes

**Users**
- Less friction
- Faster decisions
- Better group experience

**Restaurants**
- Higher-quality group traffic

**Platform**
- New interaction layer combining AI + social dynamics + consensus mechanics

---

## Extension

Group-first decision logic is extensible beyond food:
- Travel
- Events
- Activities
- Shared purchases
